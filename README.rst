`Flask`_ + Dashboard = Flash. A project dashboard *that works*.


Deploying it
------------

1. **Heroku**

   |Deploy to Heroku|_

2. **Cloud Foundry**

   Flash can easily be deployed to any `Cloud Foundry`_ environment. An
   example ``manifest.yml`` is included with the project, showing how to
   configure the deployment with an app name and a random route. Once you
   have installed the CLI and selected an appropriate target org and space,
   you can simply ``cf push``.

3. **Docker**

   Alternatively, build a Docker container as below and deploy to an online
   container hosting service.

Configuring it
--------------

There are three environment variables that Flash is aware of:

* ``PORT`` - the port to bind to (defaults to 5000)
* ``FLASK_SECRET_KEY`` - the secret key for `Flask sessions`_ (they aren't
  currently used, but it's good practice to set it to a random value)
* ``FLASH_CONFIG`` - the configuration, described below

The configuration, either saved in ``config.json`` at the project root or as the
``$FLASH_CONFIG`` environment variable, should look like::

    {
      "project_name": <name of the project>,
      "services": [
        {
          "name": "tracker",
          "api_token": <your API token>,
          "project_id": <your project ID>
        }
      ]
    }

If both the environment variable and the config file are provided, the
environment variable takes precedence.

If loading from ``config.json``, any value in the ``"services"`` settings that
``$LOOKS_LIKE_THIS`` (leading ``$``, capital letters and underscores only) will
be assumed to be an environment variable and retrieved accordingly. This lets
you version control most of your configuration without leaking API tokens and
other secrets.

Settings
........

* ``project_name`` - the project's name to display in the footer (defaults to
  ``"unnamed"``)
* ``services`` - an array of service configurations (see `flash_services`_ for
  details and configuration options)
* ``style`` - the stylesheet to use (defaults to ``"default"``, which is
  currently the only option...)
* ``project_end`` - the end data and time of the project, in any format accepted
  by `Moment.js`_. If provided, a countdown to this point will be shown in the
  footer (no default, if not provided no countdown is shown).

Running it
----------

If you just want to run Flash locally, you can use the included ``Dockerfile``
to build and run a `Docker`_ container. This is a two-step process, after which
Flash will be available at ``http://localhost:5000``::

    docker build -t textbook/flash .
    docker run -p 5000:80 textbook/flash

If your ``config.json`` includes environment variable references, or you want
to override the configuration completely with ``$FLASH_CONFIG``, you can supply
environment variables at ``docker run`` time with the ``-e`` command.

Developing it
-------------

The easiest way to install Flash for development is:

1. Install the dependencies: ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

2. Install the package in development mode: ``python3 setup.py develop``

3. To run it locally, edit ``flash/config.json`` or provide ``$FLASH_CONFIG``
   then run: ``python3 scripts/launch.py``

4. To run the tests, use ``python setup.py test`` or run ``py.test`` directly.
   In the latter case, use ``--runslow --Chrome`` (or another browser of your
   choice) to include the integration tests, and see `the docs`_ for
   ``pytest-pylint`` configuration options. For the integration tests you
   will need to ensure that ``chromedriver`` is on your PATH; on OS X, you can
   simply ``brew cask install chromedriver``.

The templates are written using the `Jinja2`_ template language.

Thunder
-------

`Thunder`_ is a new branch in the Flash repository that might eventually replace
the original. It switches the framework from Flask to `Tornado`_, allowing
asynchronous processing and websockets.
